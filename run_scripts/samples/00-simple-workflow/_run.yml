# An example of a simple scripted workflow complete with bindings.

# Run as (e.g.):
#  mls scripts run -s run_scripts/samples/00-simple-workflow/_run.yml -b training_cycles:3:int epochs_per_cycle:10:int

# BINDINGS:
training_cycles: 1
epochs_per_cycle: 1

actions:

  # Build some sample data to train on.
  - model build-sample-data

  # Prepares latest data for training.
  - model prepare --seq-end -1

  # Set up empty training and train once.
  - misc echo -m "Starting cycle 1/{{training_cycles}}..."
  - model train -e{{epochs_per_cycle}}

  # Train into latest training.
  {% for i in range(1, training_cycles) %}
  - misc echo -m "Starting cycle {{i + 1}}/{{training_cycles}}..."
  - model train -e{{epochs_per_cycle}} -i

  # Finally, test against sparse split, build predictions, and visualise.
  - model test -s sparse -p -v

  # And collect results.
